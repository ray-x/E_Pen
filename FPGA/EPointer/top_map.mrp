Total REAL time to MAP completion:  3 secs 
Total CPU time to MAP completion:   2 secs 

NOTES:

   Related logic is defined as being logic that shares connectivity - e.g. two
   LUTs are "related" if they share common inputs.  When assembling slices,
   Map gives priority to combine logic that is related.  Doing so results in
   the best timing performance.

   Unrelated logic shares no connectivity.  Map will only begin packing
   unrelated logic into a slice once 99% of the slices are occupied through
   related logic packing.

   Note that once logic distribution reaches the 99% level through related
   logic packing, this does not mean the device is completely utilized.
   Unrelated logic packing will then begin, continuing until all usable LUTs
   and FFs are occupied.  Depending on your timing budget, increased levels of
   unrelated logic packing may adversely affect the overall timing performance
   of your design.

WARNING:Security:42 - Your license support version '2010.04' for ISE expires in
-562 days.
WARNING:LIT:243 - Logical network led<2> has no load.
WARNING:LIT:395 - The above warning message base_net_load_rule is repeated 2
   more times for the following (max. 5 shown):
   led<1>,
   mcu_wr_clk_IBUF
   To see the details of these warning messages, please use the -detail switch.
WARNING:LIT:176 - Clock buffer is designated to drive clock loads. BUFGMUX
   symbol "physical_group_xclk_OBUF/clock_gene_ins/CLKFX_BUFG_INST" (output
   signal=xclk_OBUF) has a mix of clock and non-clock loads. The non-clock loads
   are:
   Pin D of cmos_ctrl_ins/clk24_r
   Pin I1 of cmos_ctrl_ins/col_cnt_and00001
   Pin I1 of cmos_ctrl_ins/xcoordinate_sum_and000026
WARNING:PhysDesignRules:367 - The signal <mcu_wr_clk_IBUF> is incomplete. The
   signal does not drive any load pins in the design.

Section 3 - Informational
-------------------------
INFO:Security:54 - 'xc3s50an' is a WebPack part.
INFO:MapLib:562 - No environment variables are currently set.
INFO:MapLib:159 - Net Timing constraints on signal clk are pushed forward
   through input buffer.
INFO:PhysDesignRules:772 - To achieve optimal frequency synthesis performance
   with the CLKFX and CLKFX180 outputs of the DCM comp
   clock_gene_ins/DCM_SP_INST, consult the device Interactive Data Sheet.

Section 4 - Removed Logic Summary
---------------------------------
   5 block(s) removed
   4 block(s) optimized away
   1 signal(s) removed

Section 5 - Removed Logic
-------------------------

The trimmed logic report below shows the logic removed from your design due to
sourceless or loadless signals, and VCC or ground connections.  If the removal
of a signal or symbol results in the subsequent removal of an additional signal
or symbol, the message explaining that second removal will be indented.  This
indentation will be repeated as a chain of related logic is removed.

To quickly locate the original cause for the removal of a chain of logic, look
above the place where that logic is listed in the trimming report, then locate
the lines that are least indented (begin at the leftmost edge).

Loadless block "clock_gene_ins/CLKDV_BUFG_INST" (CKBUF) removed.
 The signal "clock_gene_ins/CLKDV_BUF" is loadless and has been removed.
Unused block "cmos_ctrl_ins/dual_port_ram1024_ins1/GND" (ZERO) removed.
Unused block "cmos_ctrl_ins/dual_port_ram1024_ins1/VCC" (ONE) removed.
Unused block "cmos_ctrl_ins/dual_port_ram1024_ins2/GND" (ZERO) removed.
Unused block "cmos_ctrl_ins/dual_port_ram1024_ins2/VCC" (ONE) removed.

Optimized Block(s):
TYPE 		BLOCK
GND 		XST_GND
VCC 		XST_VCC
GND 		cmos_ctrl_ins/dual_port_ram1024_ins1/BU2/XST_GND
GND 		cmos_ctrl_ins/dual_port_ram1024_ins2/BU2/XST_GND

To enable printing of redundant blocks removed and signals merged, set the
detailed map report option and rerun map.
